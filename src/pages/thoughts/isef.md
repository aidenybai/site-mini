Recently, I won **3rd place** in Systems Software at the [ISEF 2021](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/2021-regeneron-isef-grand-awards/#:~:text=SOFT031). This wasn't my first endeavor into ISEF however, in the year prior I placed **2nd place** in Systems Software at [ISEF 2022](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/regeneron-isef-full-awards-2022/#:~:text=SOFT037).
